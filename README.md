* Interprets important model features
* Estimates an individual's heart disease risk probability
* Classifies the result into Low, Moderate, or High Risk
* Generates personalized, general health recommendations
* Provides an interactive terminal-based prediction system

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline performs the following operations:

* Assigns column names to the raw dataset.
* Converts `?` values into missing values.
* Converts numerical fields into appropriate numeric types.
* Handles missing values using mode imputation.
* Checks for duplicate records.
* Converts the original target into a binary classification target.
* Separates input features and target.
* Uses an 80/20 stratified train-test split.
* Standardizes numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
* Encodes categorical features using `OneHotEncoder`.

The preprocessing pipeline is included inside the trained model pipeline so that the same transformations are automatically applied during prediction.

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

The project generates visualizations including:

* Target distribution
* Age distribution
* Cholesterol vs target
* Resting blood pressure vs target
* Maximum heart rate vs target
* Correlation heatmap

| ------------------- | ---------: | ---------: | ---------: | ---------: | ---------: |
| Logistic Regression | **0.8852** |     0.8387 | **0.9286** | **0.8814** | **0.9665** |
| Decision Tree       |     0.7377 |     0.6765 |     0.8214 |     0.7419 |     0.7440 |
| Random Forest       |     0.8689 |     0.8125 | **0.9286** |     0.8667 |     0.9426 |
| SVM                 | **0.8852** |     0.8387 | **0.9286** | **0.8814** |     0.9643 |

### Final Model

**Logistic Regression** was selected as the final model using the predefined priority:

```text
1. ROC-AUC
2. Recall
3. F1-score
4. Accuracy
```

Logistic Regression achieved the highest ROC-AUC among the evaluated models:

```text
ROC-AUC : 0.9665
Recall  : 0.9286
F1      : 0.8814
Accuracy: 0.8852
```

The final trained pipeline is stored at:

```text
models/final_model.joblib
```

---

## 🔍 Feature Interpretation

Logistic Regression coefficients were analyzed to understand which transformed features had the largest influence on the model output.

The analysis includes:

* Feature name
* Coefficient
* Absolute coefficient magnitude

The complete feature analysis is available in:

```text
feature_importance.csv
```

Visualization:

```text
visualizations/feature_importance.png
```

> **Important:** Feature coefficients represent associations learned by the model from this dataset. They should not be interpreted as proof that an individual feature independently causes heart disease.

---

## 🧠 Risk Classification

The prediction probability is converted into three risk tiers:

| Probability | Risk Tier     |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| `< 30%`     | Low Risk      |
| `30% – 69%` | Moderate Risk |
| `≥ 70%`     | High Risk     |

The system uses the predicted probability generated by the final Logistic Regression pipeline.

---

## 💡 Personalized Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine uses the predicted risk probability and relevant patient features to generate general educational recommendations.

It considers factors such as:

* Resting blood pressure
* Cholesterol
* Exercise-induced angina
* Maximum heart rate
* Chest pain category
* Overall predicted risk level

The recommendation engine is implemented in:

```text
src/recommendation_engine.py
```

Smoking-based recommendations are not included because smoking information is not present in the selected dataset.

---

## 💻 Terminal Application

The main application is:

```text
src/predict.py
```

CARDIO AI provides a guided, animated terminal experience with two assessment paths:

### 📋 Report Mode
For users who have clinical/test reports. The application presents friendly descriptions while preserving the original 13-feature ML encoding.

### 💬 Simple Question Mode
For users who do not have medical reports. Instead of asking technical terms such as `slope`, `ca`, `thal`, or `oldpeak`, the application asks everyday-language questions about:

* Chest discomfort
* Chest-pain location
* When discomfort occurs
* Duration
* Fasting blood sugar
* Blood pressure availability
* Cholesterol availability
* Exercise-related discomfort

For technical clinical fields that cannot be responsibly determined from simple questions, the application uses reference values from the project's processed dataset and explicitly labels this as an **educational demonstration fallback**, not a clinical measurement.

The terminal flow is:

```text
Patient Profile
      ↓
Report Mode / Simple Question Mode
      ↓
Clinical Feature Scan
      ↓
ML Inference
      ↓
Risk Probability
      ↓
Risk Meter
      ↓
Explainable AI
      ↓
Personalized Educational Recommendations
      ↓
Prediction History + Report
```

The application supports multiple predictions during a single execution.

## 🧪 System Testing

An automated end-to-end test suite is available at:

```text
src/test_system.py
```

### Test Results

```text
Total Tests Executed : 8
Total Passed         : 8
Total Failed         : 0

System Status : SYSTEM OPERATIONAL
```

The tests verify:

* Model loading
* Feature acceptance
* Probability range
* Binary prediction output
* Risk tier classification
* Recommendation generation
* Error handling
* Low, moderate, and high-risk test cases

## ⚠️ Limitations

This project has several limitations:

1. The model is trained on a relatively small dataset of 303 records.
2. The dataset represents a specific clinical population and may not generalize to all populations.
3. The model has not undergone clinical validation.
4. The predicted probability should not be interpreted as an actual medical diagnosis.
5. The recommendation engine uses predefined rules rather than a clinically validated recommendation framework.
6. The system does not include several potentially relevant factors such as smoking history, family history, BMI, diabetes history, and medication information.
7. Model performance on this dataset does not guarantee equivalent performance on real-world patients.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

Possible future improvements include:

* Testing on larger and more diverse datasets.
* External validation using independent datasets.
* Hyperparameter optimization.
* Cross-validation and calibration analysis.
* Adding additional patient health features.
* Developing a web or mobile interface.
* Adding explainable AI techniques such as SHAP.
* Improving recommendation personalization.
* Adding secure patient data storage.
* Conducting proper clinical validation before any real-world medical application.
